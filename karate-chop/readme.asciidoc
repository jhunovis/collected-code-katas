= Karate-chop coding kata

[quote, http://codekata.com/kata/kata02-karate-chop/]
""
Write a binary chop method that takes an integer search target and a sorted array of integers.
It should return the integer index of the target in the array, or -1 if the target is not in the array.

You can assume that the array has less than 100,000 elements.
For the purposes of this Kata, time and memory performance are not issues (assuming the chop terminates before
you get bored and kill it, and that you have enough RAM to run it).

== Notes and Goals

- Take note on which errors you encounter while implementing this kata.

- Do five different implementation of the kata, e.g. varying in the programming language, iterative vs. recursive, etc.
Especially versions four and five should require some effort, since there really are not *that* many different approaches
to this problem...
