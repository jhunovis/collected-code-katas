= Fizz Buzz

This is a rather popular coding kata around an infamous job interview question.
It goes as this:

[quote, http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest]
"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of
three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five
print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
print “FizzBuzz”."
