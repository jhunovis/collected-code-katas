= Fizz Buzz

This is a rather popular coding kata around an infamous job interview question.
It goes as this:

[quote, http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?FizzBuzzTest]
"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of
three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five
print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
print “FizzBuzz”."

== Implementation

The Fizz-Buzz-kata is implemented in Java (see [src/main/kotlin/jhunovis/fizzbuzz/FizzBuzzKataJava.java])
and in Kotlin (see [src/main/kotlin/jhunovis/fizzbuzz/fizzbuzz.kt]).

Unit test have been implemented in JUnit4 for Java and Groovy Spock.
Since Kotlin has no own testing framework, the Kotlin tests merely
pull in the Java tests.
