This is a collections of katas I found on the internet including my solutions.

- For the link:berlin-clock/readme.asciidoc[Berlin Clock Kata] one must represent a day-time as the famous Berlin clock
  does.

- Number sequences have to translated to Fizz-buzz for the link:fizz-buzz/readme.asciidoc[Fizz-Buzz Kata].

- Numbers must be factorized in to their prime factors for the link:prime-factors/readme.asciidoc[Prime-factors Kata].
  This is one kata Uncle Bob mentions in his "Clean Coder" book.

- Text must be line-wrapped at a fixed column width for the link:word-wrap/readme.asciidoc[Word-wrap Kata].
  This is another one mentioned in  Robert C. Martin's "The Clean Coder" book.

- Pragmatic Dave's code katas from http://codekata.com/

  - A binary search has to implemented in at least five different ways for the link:karate-chop/readme.asciidoc[Karate-Chop Kata].

  - For the link:data-munging/readme.asciidoc[Data-munging Kata] one must process various data files.
